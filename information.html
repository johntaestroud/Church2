        <h2>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h2>
      </header> 
       <p>An <b>ETERNAL GOD</b> who is a Spirit and is everlasting throughout all generations.</p>
        
       <p>A <b>DIVINE CHRIST</b> who is the son of God and the Word of God come in the flesh.</p>
        
       <p>An <b>INFALLIBLE & INSPIRED BIBLE</b> is a non-contradictory old and new testament of the King James that harmonizes written by Holy men who wrote as God spoke to them.</p>  
        
       <p><b>SALVATION FROM SIN</b>: the life of living righteously, free from willfully committing sins that we have a clear knowledge that’s against the will of God.</p>
        
       <p>A <b>NEW BIRTH</b> is a spiritual birth, not of the flesh but of the spirit, into the family of God the church of God.</p>
        
       <p><b>ENTIRE SANCTIFICATION</b>: a work of grace upon the heart of the believer where the root of  rebellion and the inherited sin nature is purged from the heart, which is now fully submitted to the will of God. This transpires through and by a consecrated life, faith, and belief in the truth. </p> 
        
       <p><b>HOLY LIFE</b>: We teach you how to live a lifestyle that reflects the character of God. You will be consecrated and live a morally pure life in today's corrupt world.</p> 
        
       <p><b>UNITY OF GOD’S PEOPLE</b>: the world is divided because of sin, but in the church of God, we through a sanctified heart, are governed by the ruling and leading of the Holy Spirit, which causes us to walk in unity and peace. </p> 
        
       <p><b>DIVINE HEALING</b>: the word comes to heal you physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. Whatever is broken, God’s word and anointing can mend broken lives and hearts. God can divinely heal your body and give you wisdom on how to repair an unhealthy lifestyle.</p> 
        
       <p><b>THE ORDINANCES</b>: We teach you to observe what God told us to practice and that Holy Communion, which we eat bread and drink grape juice which, symbolizes the partaking of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Feet Washing, which is the washing of one another’s feet is a symbol of humility and an endeavor to keep the unity and love amongst the church. Baptism is the full submersion under water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p> 
        
       <p><b>THE TRINITY</b>: We teach and believe according to the Holy Scriptures that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three distinct divine (not human) persons in their work in the life of the believer, but all are in agreement as one. One does not work independently from the other. </p>
        
       <p><b>ETERNAL LIFE</b>: We teach and believe that we are two-fold beings consisting of both soul and body. The body is mortal and will return to the dust of the earth while the soul is eternal and will live forever beyond death, heaven being our eternal reward if the everlasting life of salvation prevails until our departure from this life.  </p>
        
       <p><b>ETERNAL PUNISHMENT</b>: We teach and believe that we are two-fold beings consisting of both soul and body. The body being mortal will return to the earth but if the soul dies in sin where God is, it will not go but rather be cast into hell eternal in torment of its flames forever.</p>

        <h2>THE DOCTRINE OF A HOLY LIFE</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        What does the Bible teaches concerning the life of those who have been born of God?
        What does it look like? The New Testament standard for God’s people is one of
        sinlessness. “We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
        begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.” <strong>&#8544 John 5:18</strong>.

        <h2>WHAT IS SIN?</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Sin is defined as: “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for
        sin is the transgression of the law.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:4</strong>. The law by which our conduct will be
        judged, the transgression of which constitutes sin, is <i>the law of Christ</i> <strong>Galations 6:2</strong>
        Jesus said, “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
        judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last
        day.</span>” <strong>John 12:48</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we shall be judged in the last day by the law of Christ, it is evident that it is the
        law of Christ (The Standard) that we are now held responsible to obey. God, being just,
        limits accountability to sin to our level of enlightenment and knowledge. The Bible
        declares: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If ye were blind,</span> [spiritually] <span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">ye should have no sin:</span>” <strong>John 9:41.</strong> “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If I had
        not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:</span>…” <strong>John 15:22</strong>. “…Sin is
        not imputed when there is no law” <strong>Romans 5:13</strong>. “where no law is, there is no
        transgression.” <strong>Romans 4:15</strong>. This principle establishes that there must be some
        knowledge of obligation for a person to be considered a willful transgressor: “Therefore
        to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” <strong>James 4:17</strong>. So also,
        on this principle, to him that knoweth that he should not do evil, and then doeth it, to him
        it is sin.

        <h2>ALL MEN BY NATURE ARE SINNERS</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        It is a fact that in all places and in all ages of the world men have acknowledged that
        they were under sin; for all realize that their wills have been involved in acts which they
        recognize to be in their very nature wrong. Therefore the Bible recognizes this
        universality of sin, saying: “There is no man that sinneth not…” <strong>&#8544 Kings 8:46</strong>. “For all
        have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” <strong>Romans 3:23</strong>. “The Scripture hath
        concluded all under sin…” <strong>Galations 3:22</strong>. But while the Old Testament recognizes the
        universal prevalence of sin, it also contains predictions of a divine provision for its
        removal. Isaiah, speaking of Christ, said, “He will come and save you” <strong>Isaiah 35:4</strong>. And
        Zechariah declared, “In that day there shall be a fountain opened…for sin and for
        uncleanness.” <strong>Zechariah 13:1</strong>. Here we find special provisions for sin. Daniel predicted the
        coming of the Messiah, saying, “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people
        and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
        and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
        righteousness,…” <strong>Daniel 9:24</strong>. All these inspired prophecies met their fulfillment in that
        Christ who came to “…save his people from their sins.” <strong>Matthew 1:21</strong>.

        <h2>CHRISTIANS ARE SAVED FROM SIN</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        “And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
        Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him,
        neither known him.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:5-6</strong>. This is the uniform gospel standard, as we shall see.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>CHRIST</b> taught it: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is
          the servant of sin...If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
          indeed.</span>” <strong>John 8:34,36</strong>. Here is promised a perfect freedom from the bondage of
          sin. In the fifth chapter of John we read of a certain impotent man lying at the
          pool of Bethesda, whose infirmity was of thirty-eight years’ duration. Jesus came
          along and healed him. “Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said
          unto him, "<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Behold, thou art made whole: SIN NO MORE, lest a worse thing
          come unto thee,</span>” <strong>John 5:14</strong>. Now, it is preposterous to suppose that Christ was
          unjust, giving a commandment that could not be obeyed a commandment whose
          violation was to bring upon the poor man a sorer punishment than he had
          endured during those thirty-eight long years. It could be obeyed! This man
          received power from the Lord to go and live without sin. Again, in <strong>John 8:3-11</strong> we
          read of a certain woman who was brought to Christ accused of great sin. After a
          short conversation, during which time the scribes and Pharisees, becoming
          condemned by their consciences because of their own sins, went away, Jesus
          turned to the woman and said, “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Where are those thine accusers? hath no
          man condemned thee</span> [legally]?" She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said
          unto her, “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Neither do I condemn thee: GO AND SIN NO MORE.</span>”
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PETER</b> taught it: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
          be blotted out; when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
          of the Lord” <strong>Acts 3:19</strong>. “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
          that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in
          his mouth:” <strong>&#8544 Peter 2:21-22</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PAUL</b> taught it: “Awake to righteousness, and <b>sin not</b>; for some have not the
          knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.” <strong>&#8544 Corinthians 15:34-35</strong>. Almost the
          whole of the sixth chapter of Romans is devoted to the subject of the Christians’
          deliverance from sin. I will notice just a few verses wherein it is stated. “What
          shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God
          forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?” <strong>Romans
          6:1-2</strong>. “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
          alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in
          your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof” <strong>Romans 6:11-12</strong>.
          “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but
          under grace.” <strong>Romans 6:14</strong>. “…Ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
          obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being
          then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.” <strong>Romans 6:17-18</strong>. 
          “But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,
          ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.” <strong>Romans 6:22</strong>.
          Some people attempt to prove that Paul himself was a sinner and a defender of
          sin; but this chapter alone is sufficient to forever settle his attitude as a Christian
          toward the subject of sin. This point we will refer to again in the present chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>JOHN</b> taught it: “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
          fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
          cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, [to be cleansed
          from], we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our
          sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
          unrighteousness.” <strong>&#8544 John 1:7-9</strong>. Here, a perfect cleansing from sin is taught,
          upon condition that we do not cover our sins up and deny them, but “walk in the
          light” and “confess our sins.” And the same writer also shows that we must live
          before Christ in this sinless state, for he says, “He that saith he abideth in him
          ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.” <strong>&#8544 John 2:6</strong>. How did Christ
          walk? Peter affirms that he “did no sin, neither was guile found in his
          mouth.” <strong>&#8544 Peter 2:22</strong>. Hence we must do no sin. This is the Christian standard. So
          John writes again, “My little children, these things I write unto you, THAT YE
          SIN NOT…” <strong>&#8544 John 2:1</strong>. In the same verse he goes on to show that “if any man
          sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” 

          This shows that, even if men should by some means depart from the Christian
          standard by falling into sin, it is possible for them to be recovered, because Christ
          would be willing to forgive again. This, however, does not in the least weaken the
          standard here set forth that “he that saith he abideth in him ought himself
          also so to walk, even as he walked.” <strong>&#8544 John 2:6</strong>. But the apostle goes a step
          further; he shows not only that Christians “ought” to walk this way, but that they
          really do. “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
          not seen him, neither known him.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:6</strong>. “We know that whosoever is
          born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself,
          and that wicked one toucheth him not.” <strong>&#8544 John 5:18</strong>. “Little children, let no
          man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is
          righteous. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
          remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:7,9</strong>. 
          Reader, mark this fact: John does not say that "God’s people confess their sins
          every day or repent of them frequently", but says that they “DO NOT COMMIT
          SIN.” Thousands of professed Christians have asked the question, “Who are
          those `just persons which need no repentance,’ of which Christ speaks”
          <strong>Luke 15:7</strong>? The answer is very clear: They are the Christians, those who have
          been born of God; for “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.” They
          need not, and hence could not, repent.

        <h2>WHAT’S BEING TAUGHT BY PASTORS TODAY?</h2>
      </header>
        <p>        
          Are Pastors today following the same example as the Disciples? In today’s
          ecumenical and universal protestant church environments, the phrase &quot;I don&#39;t
          practice sin&quot; has become a common justification used to soften the biblical
          standard of holiness and sinlessness. Many religious groups adopt this language
          to acknowledge human weakness while avoiding the call to absolute freedom
          from sin as outlined in Scripture. While this statement might seem humble or
          realistic, it falls short of the biblical teaching that those who are truly born of God
          &quot;do not commit sin&quot; <strong>&#8544 John 3:9</strong>. The concept of &quot;not practicing sin&quot; often
          leaves room for moral failure, portraying sin as inevitable and excusable rather
          than conquerable through Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
          This reasoning allows individuals to maintain a duality: identifying as Christians
          while continuing to fall short of biblical holiness. By saying, &quot;I don&#39;t practice sin,&quot;
          people imply that as long as sin is not habitual or premeditated, it does not
          compromise their spiritual standing. However, this interpretation undermines the
          transformative power of salvation. It assumes that sin is an occasional misstep
          rather than a condition from which believers are completely delivered through the
          new birth in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Issue with &quot;Not Practicing Sin&quot; in Modern Church Culture - Shifting
          Standards of Holiness: In many modern church contexts, this phrase
          reflects a compromise with worldly standards. It allows individuals to live in
          a state of spiritual complacency, where sin is viewed as an unavoidable
          part of life. Churches that propagate this belief often emphasize “saved by
          grace” without accountability, focusing on the forgiveness side of salvation
          rather than on transformation side. This message contradicts Paul&#39;s
          teaching: &quot;Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God
          forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&quot;
        <strong>Romans 6:1-2</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tolerance of Sinful Behaviors: The phrase &quot;I don&#39;t practice sin&quot; creates a
          loophole for tolerating behaviors that Scripture condemns. In ecumenical
          circles, where unity among denominations often takes precedence over
          doctrinal purity, this approach minimizes the gravity of sin to avoid
          alienating individuals, not to offend and to secure memberships without
          disruption of hard sayings. This broad acceptance of imperfection dilutes
          the message of sanctification and hinders believers from striving for the
          holiness that God requires: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” <strong>&#8544 Peter 1:16</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excusing Spiritual Weakness: The concept of &quot;not practicing sin&quot; can
          become an excuse for spiritual weakness and a lack of discipline. Instead
          of relying on the grace and power of God to overcome sin, individuals may
          accept repeated failures as part of the Christian experience. This mindset
          contradicts John&#39;s declaration: “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not;”
          <strong>&#8544 John 3:6</strong>. The Gospel calls for a life of victory over sin, not a tolerance
          of it.
        </p>  
         <p>
          Redefining Repentance: This justification often distorts the biblical concept
          of repentance. Genuine repentance involves a complete turning away
          from sin, not merely an effort to avoid habitual wrongdoing. Saying, &quot;I don&#39;t
          practice sin,&quot; downplays the seriousness of even occasional sin and
          suggests that repentance is only necessary for egregious or repeated
          offenses. However, Scripture commands believers to “go on to
          perfection” <strong>Hebrews 6:1</strong> in their walk with Christ: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Be ye therefore
          perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect</span>” <strong>Matthew
          5:48</strong>.

        <h2>THE BIBLICAL STANDARD</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Sinlessness through Grace: The Bible does not
        describe salvation as a partial victory over sin or a balancing act between
        sin and righteousness. Instead, it teaches that true believers are
        empowered by God’s grace to live above sin entirely. John writes:
        “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
        remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” <strong>&#8544
        John 3:9</strong>. This does not imply human perfection apart from God but
        highlights the transformative work of grace that makes sin incompatible
        with the Christian life.

        <h2>SIN AS BONDAGE</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Jesus stated: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Whosoever committeth sin is the
        servant </span>(slave) <span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">of sin</span>” <strong>John 8:34</strong>. To claim that occasional sin is
        acceptable undermines Christ’s promise of freedom: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If the Son
        therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed</span> (for-sure)”
        <strong>John 8:36</strong>. When the Son make you free, what is He making you free
        from? Let the word of God answer “But now being made free from sin,
        and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and
        the end everlasting life.” <strong>Romans 6:22</strong>. In the midst of false prophets
        and ecumenical protestant religious denominational environments where
        every one of them claim to have truth, Jesus makes a clear distinction on
        how to identify the truth that “MAKES” men free. He said “you shall know
        the TRUTH (who and what is right) and the truth shall “MAKE” you free.
        The gospel should be ringing the doctrine of Jesus “Go and sin no more”
        from pulpits today. But sadly the people are ignorant, being destroyed for
        the lack of knowledge. 
        
        “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
        word of God.” <strong>Romans 10:17</strong> “…and how shall they hear without a
        preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent?”
      <strong>Romans 10:14,15</strong>. Faith in God’s word to live free from sin must be
        heard and believed. If not the people will never TURN from sin completely.
        “I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to
        them, yet they prophesied. But if they had stood in my counsel, and
        had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have
        TURNED them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.”
        <strong>Jeremiah 23:21</strong>. It’s difficult to preach what one doesn’t believe or live
        “day-in” and “day-out”. “But there were false prophets also among the
        people, even as there shall be false teachers among you…Having
        eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin... And many
        shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of
        truth (freedom from sin) shall be evil spoken of.” <strong>&#8544&#8544 Peter 2:1,2,14</strong>

        <h2>GRACE TO OVERCOME</h2>

      <p>
        Paul teaches that believers are no longer under the
        dominion of sin: “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are
        not under the law, but under grace.” <strong>Romans 6:14</strong>. Grace empowers
        believers to live righteously, not to excuse sin.

        <h2>MODERN-DAY SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        They must reject the justification of “not
        practicing sin” as a diluted form of holiness. True Christianity demands a
        life that reflects the righteousness of Christ. While human weakness
        exists, the Gospel offers a complete remedy through the indwelling power
        of the Holy Spirit. Paul wrote: “I can do all things through Christ which
        strengtheneth me.” <strong>Philippians 4:13</strong>, affirming that victory over sin is
        both possible and expected for those who walk in the Spirit.

        <h2>THE LINE OF DISTINCTION</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        A discussion once took place between a Church of God minister and two Protestant
        ministers who vehemently denied the doctrine that Christians can live free from sin,
        despite the overwhelming evidence of this truth in the New Testament. The Church of
        God minister posed a simple yet profound question: “What is the difference between
        sinners and these so-called ‘sinning Christians’?” The Protestant ministers
        responded that &quot;sinning Christians&quot; confess their sins and ask for forgiveness daily,
        while sinners do not. The Church of God minister replied, “From what you’ve
        described, their lifestyles look very much the same to me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This response underscores a fundamental issue in modern theology: the attempt to blur
        the line between the life of a true Christian and that of a sinner. Some claim that
        Christians sin every day and attempt to justify this belief by quoting <strong>Matthew 18:21-22</strong>:
        “Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me,
        and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">I say not unto thee,
        Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven</span>.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This scripture, however, does not support the idea that Christians are allowed to commit
        sin daily. It is entirely misapplied. The context of this passage is not about Peter sinning,
        nor is it about personal sin against God. Instead, it addresses how often a believer
        should forgive a brother who sins or offends them. Jesus was teaching the principle of
        limitless forgiveness, not endorsing the idea of habitual sin in the life of a believer. This
        passage calls for forgiveness in human relationships, not leniency toward sin in our walk
        with God.
      </p>
      <p>
        God&#39;s Clear Line of Demarcation
        The Bible draws a distinct and unmistakable line between sinners and Christians. As
        previously demonstrated through numerous scriptures, God’s people are saved from
        their sins and do not commit sin:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:6</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:9</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          “We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.” <strong>&#8544 John 5:18</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The distinction is absolute: those who are born of God are empowered to live without
        sin. To suggest otherwise diminishes the transformative power of salvation and the
        sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. While sinners are bound by sin, true Christians walk
        in righteousness, reflecting the nature of their Savior: “He that doeth righteousness is
        righteous, even as he is righteous.” <strong>&#8544 John 3:7</strong>.
        God’s standard is clear. A life of holiness is not merely aspirational; it is the expected
        outcome of being born again. The idea of “sinning Christians” is a contradiction to the
        Word of God and undermines the truth that “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If the Son therefore shall make you free,
        ye shall be free indeed.</span>” <strong>John 8:36</strong>.

        <h2>SOME OBJECTIONS ANSWERED</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        When the doctrine of salvation from sin and a holy, sinless life is presented, people
        frequently come forward with certain objections to this standard. Now, so far as these
        objections are sincere, based upon certain Scripture texts, they are worthy of
        consideration and explanation; for when rightly interpreted, they harmonize beautifully
        with the general plan of redemption. There is no contradiction on this subject in God’s
        Word when understood in relation to His progressive plan of salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objection 1</strong>. “…There is no man that sinneth not…” <strong>&#8544 Kings 8:46</strong>. “For there is not a just
        man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.” <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:20</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Answer: These words were uttered by King Solomon, who lived about one
          thousand years before Christ, in the dispensation when it was “…not possible
          that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.” <strong>Hebrews 10:4</strong>. Many men
          of that dispensation possessed great faith in God and, considering the general
          standards of those times, lived very good lives; hence they were accepted by
          God on the ground of their faith, when they conformed to the highest standard of
          His revealed will. But the experience of the new birth, the regeneration of the soul
          which makes men “new creatures,” was not realized in those days; hence people
          then did not claim to live without committing sin. The plan of salvation from all sin
          through Christ was from the foundation of the world a “mystery” which was “hid in
          God” <strong>Ephesians 3:9</strong>, a mystery which even “…the angels desired to look into” <strong>&#8544 Peter
          1:12</strong>, but which in the gospel dispensation “…is made manifest to his saints” <strong>Colossians
          1:26</strong>. Jesus said to His disciples, “…<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Many prophets and righteous men</span> [of the old
          dispensation] <span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen
          them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. Blessed
          are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</span>” <strong>Matthew. 13:17,16</strong>. 
           <br><br>
          These prophets, however, caught a glimpse of this coming redemption, and wrote of it,
          though they did not themselves experience it. This is clearly stated by Peter, who
          wrote concerning brethren in the new dispensation: “Receiving the end of your
          faith, even the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets have
          inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come
          unto you: Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was
          in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the
          glory that should follow. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves,
          but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by
          them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
          from heaven…” <strong>&#8544 Peter 1:9-12</strong>. This makes it clear that the experience of salvation
          which we now receive through Christ was not experienced before His coming,
          even by the prophets who wrote of it. Those who deny the sinless life are sure to
          quote <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:20</strong>, which says that “there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth
          good, and sinneth not.” But why do they not quote <strong>&#8544 John 3:9</strong>, which says that
          “whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin”? Do these texts appear
          contradictory? So they are in statement, but they are not contradictory in the plan
          of God, for Solomon wrote under the old dispensation, while John wrote under
          the new. The true basis of harmony is found in the fact that “…the blood of Jesus
          Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.” <strong>&#8544 John 1:7</strong>.
        </li>
       </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Objection 2</strong>. Paul’s experience in <strong>Romans 7:18-24</strong>, where he says: “I know that in me
          dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
          good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I
          do. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find
          then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. Oh, wretched man that I
          am!” etc.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Answer: A study of the entire chapter shows clearly that the apostle was
            describing his experience under the law of Moses, before he found Christ. He
            first speaks of his infantile state, when he was “alive without the law”—did not
            even know that the law said, “Thou shalt not covet.” Afterward “when the
            commandment came” to him, he says, “sin revived, and I died.” (See verses 7-
            13.) This law under which he was brought up was good in that it defined sin and
            revealed his condition as an actual sinner, but it did not bring to him deliverance
            and salvation from sin; therefore he cried out, “Oh, wretched man that I am! who
            shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Then he obtained a ray of hope
            and answered the question himself: “I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord”
            (Verses 24-25.) This sin-experience was the experience of Saul, the man who
            zealously defended the law and persecuted the church of God; but immediately
            following we have, in his own words, the experience of Paul the Christian: “There
            is therefore NOW no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk
            not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
            Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law [of
            Moses] could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
            Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that
            the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh,
            but after the Spirit.” <strong>Romans 8:1-4</strong>. Reader, which do you desire, the experience of
            Saul, or the experience of Paul? After he found deliverance from sin through
            Christ, he taught that Christians are to live without sin. “…Shall we continue in
            sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live
            any longer therein?” <strong>Romans 6:1-2</strong>. “For sin shall not have dominion over you: FOR
            YE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW, BUT UNDER GRACE” verse 14. This last text
            clears up the entire matter. Under the law sin had dominion over the people;
            under grace, God’s people have dominion over sin. Under the law, it might be
            said, “There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not;” but
            under grace, “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.” “The law was
            given by Moses; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ” <strong>John 1:17</strong>. Yea, “the
            grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that,
            denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
            godly, in this present world.” Why? Because Christ “gave himself for us, that he
            might redeem us from ALL iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
            zealous of good works.” <strong>Titus 2:11-14</strong>. That the sin-experience described in
            Romans 7 was not the experience of Paul the Christian at the time when he was
            writing this chapter, is shown also by other facts. 
            <br><br>
            This Epistle was writing about the year A.D. 60. Six years before this time, or in A.D. 54, he was living a much
            better life than that; for he declared to the Thessalonian brethren, “Ye are
            witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved
            ourselves among you that believe.” <strong>&#8544 Thessalonians 2:10</strong>. Was he a backslider at the
            time when he wrote the Roman Epistle? No; for about that same year, A.D. 60,
            he testified before a council, “…I have lived in all good conscience before God
            until this day” <strong>Acts 23:1</strong>. And a few days later he said, “Herein do I exercise
            myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward
            men.” <strong>Acts 24:16</strong>. Neither did he dishonor God and His cause by departing into
            sin after this time, for in his dying testimony, given about six years later, he said:
            “…The time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished
            my course, I have kept the faith.” <strong>&#8544&#8544 Timothy 4:6-7</strong>. Objections based on certain other
            texts of Scripture (for example, <strong>Romans 3:10</strong>) are of this same general character;
            for almost without exception they relate to Old Testament conditions, not to the
            New Testament standard of salvation. The doctrine of sinning Christians
            originates either in a perverse state of the soul or else in a total failure to
            understand dispensational truth; for this last-named fact disposes of all the
            objections to holiness. A proper understanding of the difference between the old
            covenant and the new will forever settle the subject concerning the present
            relation of God’s people with sin.

        <h2>THE STANDARD OF A HOLY LIFE</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Sin comes in various forms as worldliness. Since sin in its various forms has become
        universal, surrounding us on all sides, as real as nature itself, the Bible writers often
        refer to it as “the world.” This includes not only the grosser forms of sin, but all manner
        of disobedience to God of whatsoever nature or extent. God’s people must be free from
        all these things. Paul says to the brethren who had been quickened in Christ, “…In time
        past ye walked according to the course of this world…” <strong>Ephesians 2:2</strong>. But Christ “…gave
        himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world…” <strong>Galations 1:4</strong>, that
        our separation from the world in this sense is to be real, is shown by the words of Christ,
        “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the
        world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span>” <strong>John
        15:19</strong>. Reader, bear in mind that if you take your stand for God and for the whole truth
        of His Word, determined to be free from all worldliness, there will be a real separation in
        spirit and in life between you and the worldly minded. You will even have opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” <strong>&#8544&#8544 Timothy 3:12</strong>.
        This experience was truly realized by the first disciples, for we have the testimony of
        Jesus Himself that they were free from the world. He said of them in prayer to the
        Father: “<span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are
        not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them
        out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the
        world, even as I am not of the world.</span>” <strong>John 17:14-16</strong>. To us this means that everything
        which partakes of the spirit and nature of the world must be forsaken—worldly
        sentiments, worldly associations, worldly ambitions, worldly amusements, and worldly
        dress—everything that is not in strict harmony with the plain teaching of God’s Word.
        “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world,
        the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and
        the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the
        world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth
        forever.” <strong>&#8544 John 2:15-17</strong>.

        <h2>WORLDLY DRESS</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        The Word of God comes even closer and lays down certain rules concerning the
        Christian’s dress. The command of the Word is, “…Glorify God in your body, and in your
        spirit, which are God’s.” <strong>&#8544 Corinthians 6:20</strong>. We must “…be holy both in body and in spirit…” <strong>&#8544
        Corinthians 7:34</strong>. If we have holy, humble hearts, hearts free from vanity and pride, then our
        outward lives must in every way be consistent with the inward condition. Now, when
        people’s hearts are full of the “pride of life,” how do they manifest it? By proud actions
        and by worldly dress. They seek to adorn themselves with gold, pearls, diamonds,
        rubies, and costly array; until the beholder views a dazzling display of ear-rings, finger-
        rings, bracelets, lockets, and other ornaments; not to mention an immense amount of
        other costly, useless, and foolish array. What does the Word of God say on this subject?
        “Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing
        of gold, or of putting on of apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that
        which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the
        sight of God of great price.” <strong>&#8544 Peter 3:3-4</strong>. 
        <br><br>Yet how many professing Christians totally
        disregard the plain teaching of the Word on this point, and dress in all the pride and
        fashion of this world! In the scriptures just given, the apostle Peter forbids the wearing of
        that outward adornment which women must be dressed. He says, “In like manner also,
        that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety;
        not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women
        professing godliness) with good works.” <strong>&#8544 Timothy 2:9-10</strong>. They must be arrayed in “modest
        apparel...not with gold, or pearls, or costly array.” These articles of adornment, then, are
        not modest apparel. The wearing of them is prompted, not by feelings of humility and
        modesty, but by pride in the heart. It is plain from this scripture that such things do not
        “become women professing godliness.” Reader, are you a woman “professing
        godliness”? Are you adorned with these things? If so, then they do not “become your
        profession,” and you are not arrayed in “modest apparel.” “Modest apparel” requires a
        dress that is clean and neat, so as not to become immodest, through the failure to
        measure up to ordinary standards of decency; but, on the other hand, it is dress that is
        free from useless, worldly trimmings and accompaniments, from ostentation and show.
        Ear-rings, finger-rings, necklaces, lockets, bracelets, and many other like things, “are
        not of the Father, but are of the world,” when it comes to the matter of the Christian’s
        dress. “BE NOT CONFORMED TO THIS WORLD,” the Word of God rings out <strong>Romans
        12:2</strong>, and all the pure and holy in heart are ready to say amen. These principles apply
        with equal force to the male sex. The foolish, vain, and immodest styles and fashions to
        which the worldly-minded cater are an abomination in the sight of God and in the sight
        of His redeemed saints. Do not deceive yourself, reader, in the belief that you can
        continue to wear things which the Word of God forbids, and still be a spiritual person,
        filled with the grace of God. It is impossible. God’s children are to be “…obedient
        children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance.” <strong>&#8544
        Peter 1:14</strong>. How often we meet professing Christians who are living in open violation of
        this part of the Bible, and who, when we mention the fact to them, are ready to excuse
        themselves, saying, “Oh, these things are not in my heart!” Well, if they are not in the
        heart, then why are they carried about on the person? When we enter the city and see a
        display sign outside of a store, we naturally expect to find the goods thus advertised
        kept in stock in that store. <br><br>Now, we know that proud people manifest their pride in their
        dress. If you are humble in heart, free from this worldly abomination, and do not wish to
        be mistaken for a proud person, then take down the sign. If you think these things are
        not in your heart, then it will be a very easy matter for you to prove it by obeying God’s
        Word and removing them from your person. When you undertake to do this, however,
        you may find, as thousands of others have found, that the love of such things goes
        deeper than you have ever imagined. Your teeth may rest so easily in your mouth that
        you seldom think of them; but when the dentist attempts to remove one, you become
        painfully aware of the fact that it has long roots and draws hard. Similarly, you may be so
        accustomed to wearing worldly adornments that they seem perfectly natural and easy,
        so that you are deceived into thinking that they are all on the outside; but when you
        attempt to obey God’s Word and discard them, you will find that they are rooted in your
        affections and reach down deep into the soul. But Jesus says, “… <span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">If a man love me, he
        will keep my words</span>…” <strong>John 14:23</strong>. “… <span style="color: rgb(193, 30, 30);">Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</span>” <strong>Luke 6:46</strong>.

        <h2>THE POSITIVE SIDE</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Nor is holy life to be judged solely by a negative standard— by what we put off of sin
        and worldliness. There is a positive side. When we die to the world, we “put on Christ.”
        Then we can say with the apostle Paul, “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live;
        yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the
        faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” <strong>Galations 2:20</strong>. Our whole
        desire is to manifest Christ to the world. Being “risen with Christ,” we “seek those things
        which are above” <strong>Colossians 3:1</strong>. We “put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and
        beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;”
        <strong>Colossians 3:12</strong>. The graces of the Spirit implanted within find outward expression in “the fruit
        of the Spirit,” which is “love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
        meekness, temperance…” <strong>Galations 5:22-23</strong>. Our aim in life is to have always a conscience
        void of offense toward God and toward man. But even in this we do not allow the voice
        of conscience alone to dictate in matters of religions faith, but we render loving and
        willing obedience to all the commandments of our Lord and require our conscience to
        come into line with what the Word plainly says. Thus our lives are free and happy, and
        are made a blessing to all around us. This phase of the subject will be more fully treated
        hereafter. Oh, how much it means to serve God “…without fear, in holiness and
        righteousness before him all the days of our life.” <strong>Luke 1:74-75</strong>!
